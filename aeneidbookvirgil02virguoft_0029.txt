111 the world. Aeneas 111 ancient times and Augustus in
his own day are regarded as instmments in the hands ot fate.
which is a great inscrutable power working out its purposes
in the world through the agency of Rome.

With this idea os universal enipire is combined a reverence
for antiquity‚ for old customs‚ for the religious saith of eat-1 3·
Italy, and an attachment to all places connected with the his-

0 The Aeneid then, as an epic describing the great part Rome

the civil wars that had been raging so long, and by the desire
felt everywhere in his days for the restoration of peace, law,
order and piety. This desire was met by Augustus’ policy,
and in this lay the security of Augustus-⁷ position.

Dido stands out as the most lite-like and interesting charac-
ter Virgil has drawn, and even if she does represent to the
Roman the hated race of Carffiaginians, and even it her deser-
tion by Aeneas calls forth no hint of condemnation froin the
poet, we cannot but feel that Virgil sympatheticassy entered
into the tragic nature of Dido’s story·

Apart from character the main sources of human interest
developed in the Aeneid are: the nobility and dignity of the
story itseli, apart from its connection with the national senti-

Troy, and the foundation of Carthage3 the scenes familiar,

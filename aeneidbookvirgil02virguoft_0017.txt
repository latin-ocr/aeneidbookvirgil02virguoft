son Hector, and Aeneas, the latter being the son of Venus and
a Trojan prince, Anchises. The Greeks did not surround the
city, but encamped on the shore near their ships and many
battles took place on the plain before Troy. In these nine
years the Greeks succeeded in driving the Trojans within the
walls and in gaining the surrounding towns. In the tenth
year a notable quarrel arose between Agamemnon and Achilles,
and for a time, while Achilles held aloof from fighting, the
Trojans had the better of it. But at last they slew his dearest
friend, Patroclus, and urged by his grief and anger he returned
to the battle and slew Hector, the bulwark of the Trojans.
Soon Achilles himself was slain by Paris, and his son Pyrrhus
or Neoptolemus was brought to the soene of war. But when
nothing seemed to bring them success, the Greeks tried strata-
gem, and pretended to sail away homewards, leaving a huge
wooden horse as an offering to Minerva. This the Trojans
drew rejoicing within their walls, but within it were concealed
many of the bravest Greeks who issued from the horse by
night, seized the gates and aided by the other Greeks, who had
returned in the fleet, took the city and destroyed it.
’ In this war the gods took part, some, like J une, Neptune,
Pallas and Apollo. favoring the Greeks, others, like Venus and
Mars, aiding Troy, though the latter were unable to prevail
over the destiny decreed by fate for Priam and his city.
Aeneas escaped from the burning town and with some fol-
lowers sailed away under 1110 special protection of his mother
Venus, to found a new city. After many disappointments
and wonderful adventures he landed in Italy, and from the
settlement he planted there grew the great city of Rome, that
in Virgil's day had become the mistress of the whole civilized
world. Aeneas’ adventures and experiences form the subject
of the poem called the Aeneid.

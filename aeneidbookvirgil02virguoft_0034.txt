may be marked osf3 then the quantity of syllables long or
short by position, according to the preceding rules‚ can be
marked 3 after which the first four feet can, in alarge majority
of cases, bc settled beyond a doubt, without any reference to
the natural quantity ot* the vowels. Finally (and this is all-
important, if the student is ever to get beyond this rule of
thumb and catch the rhythm of Virgil), the line when scanned
should be read over according to the division made. *⁴²

(JAEsURA.

When a word ends within a foot, a caesura is said to occur,
and in the dactylic hexameter, the caesura, or caesar-al pause
when it coincides with a pause in the sense constitutes much
of the charm of the rhythm, the line falling into two unequal
parts.

The favorite caesura] pause occurs in the third foot, but
sometimes it comes in the fourth foot, in which case there is
often another pause in the second foot, the line thus being
divided into three parts.

The pause is far more often after the long syllable of a
dactylic foot than after the first short syllable †

XVhen in B. C. 41 peace for a time did come, the victorious
Octavian confiscated large tracts of land in Italy and distri-
buted them among his soldiers. Virgil's farm (his father being
now dead) was thus seized on, but Virgil had become favorably
known to Asinius Pollio, the governor of the district, and at
his suggestion Virgil went to Rome and appealed to Augustus.
Restitution was made by order of Augustus, though Virgil did
not regain his farm, and soon we find virgil living at Rome
under the patronage of the court, and on ternis of intimacy
with the leading writers of the day. His first volume of
poetry, the EclogueS, a collection of ‘ten pastoral poems, com-
menced before he came to Rome, was completed in B. C. 37, and
soon after he left Rome and for most of his remaining years

. lived in Campania near Naples. From BC. 37 to 30 he worked

at his second great poem, the GeorgicS, a series of four poems
on husbandry as one of the glories ot Italian life. The
remaining eleven years of his life were devoted to his great epic
poem, the Aeneid. We are told that in Β. C. ‘23 he read Books
IL, IV. and VI. to Augustus at the latter⁷s request. In Ro.
19 the poet had completed his epic, but intended to devote
three years more to polishing and revising it. Howeven
while on a voyage to Greece and Asia that year, he fell
sick at Athens and returned, dying just as he reached
Italy. ’

In his last illness, dissatisfied with the condition of the
Aeneid, he asked his executors to burn it, but fortunately
Augustus forbade their carrying out Virgil‘s last wish.

In person Virgil is said to have been tall and dark, of rustic
even awkward appearance. He was gentle, shy and reserved
i1i manner, and the purity of his lite gained him the name of
Parthenias, ‘the maiden. ’ No authentic picture exists.

The tomb in which virgil was buried near Naples long
remained an object of veneration, and Virgil himself in the
middle agae came to be looked upon as a sage, magician and
prophet.

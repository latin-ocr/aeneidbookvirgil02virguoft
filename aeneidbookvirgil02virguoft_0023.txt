INTRODUCTION. XV

Venus seeks and is promised the protection of Neptune 101
her son, but one condition is imposed, that one life shall be
lost. And so that night while the fleet is going quickly on its
way, the god of sleep descendS, puts Palinurus, Aeneas' pilot,
to sleep and hurls him into the sea.

BOOK VI. —Aeneas lands at Cumae in Italy, and visits the
Sibyl, the priestess of Apollo. Aeneas offers his vows to the
god who through the Sibyl prophesies fresh dangers in Italy,
but a successful issue. He then asks how he may descend to
the lower world where dwell the dead, to see his father. The
priestess gives him instructions, and after the funeral rites are
paid to Misenus, one of Aeneas' followers who has just died, he
sets out, attended by the Sibyl, through the cavern where lay
the entrance 10 Hades.

Here on their way they behold many monsters and terrible
spirits, and come to the river over which the souls of the dead
are ferried by the boatman Charon. On the banks they see
wandering the unburied dead, unable 10 cross for a hundred
years. They cross the Styx, pacify 1110 three-headed Cerberus
guarding the entrance, and pass through the regions where
dwell the shades of infants, the falsely condemned, suicides‚
and those who have died for love. Here Dido is met, but she
disdains to look at Aeneas. Then they come to the fields
where warriors dwell, among them many of the heroes who
fought at Troy. Tartarus, where the guilty dead are pun·
ished, is next reached.

Soon they come 10 1110 abode of ,the blessed, where dwell the
pure priests, and poetS, those who fell fighting for their coun-
try, and all who have brought beauty 01 good to mankind.
Here Anchises is found, surveying countless nations, souls
who have once lived on earth and after a long period of puri-
fication are to be born again. There Aeneas sees the long line
of men who were to be famous in Alba and in Rome, and after
Anchises has told him of the wars he must himself wage, he
returns to earth through the gate of dreams. Returning to
his ‹- =mrades, he sets 5011, coasting northward.

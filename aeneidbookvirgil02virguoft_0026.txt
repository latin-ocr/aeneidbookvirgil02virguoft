xviii INTRODUCTION.

has reconciled Juno to Turnus' defeat, Aeneas has his foe at
his mercy. Turnus begs for quarter, and Aeneas is about to
grant it, when he catches sight of the spoils of his young
friend Pallas, and in wrath plunges his sword in Turnus'
heart.

So ends Virgil's story. Aeneas after the war married Lavi-
nia, and from them was sprung the line of kings who reigned
in Alba Longa, as well as Romulus the founder of Rome.
From his son Ascanius or Iulus, by Creusa, was said to be
descended the Julian family, who⁷ in the person of the Caesars,
became the imperial rulers of Rome in Virgil's days.

ΙΙΙ. —LIFE OF VIRGIL.

Publius Vergilius* Maro was born Rc. 70 at the little vil-
lage οἱ Andes near Mantua, in the great northern plain os
Italy⁷ watered by the river Padus⁷ the modern Po. The people
of this country were of Gallic- descent aud not close kinsmen of
the Romans or southern Italians, and it was not till virgil
was twenty-one years of age that they were made full Roman
citizens Virgil's father lived on a small farm, but was able
to give his son all the advantages of education to be obtained·
in those day-S, perhaps seeing early in his boy some signs of
future greatness. Except that Virgil studied in Cremona and
Milan and at sixteen was sent to Rome to the best teachers
there, we know practicall y nothilng of his youth. This period

, fell between the two great civil wars of Rome, and from what
we know of Virgil's nature, the comparative peace of his boy-
hood and youth was more congenial than the civil wars that
raged from his twenty-second to his sortieth year.

 

*There seems to be no doubt that the correct spelling is Vergilius,
and scarcely less doubt that to the English reader the poet will always
be virgil.

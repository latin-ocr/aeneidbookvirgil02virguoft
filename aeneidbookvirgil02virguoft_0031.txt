(Aen. ι. 462) he has given imperishable expression, andehich
fills with strange insight, and profound emotion those lonely
words and pathetio half lines where he has sounded the depths
of beauty and sorrow, of patience and magnanimity, of honor
in lite and hope beyond death. ²

Perhaps nothing so completely expresses the modern view
of virgil as the lines of Tennyson (himself the most Virgilian
of all our modern poets), written ab the requesh of the people
of Mantua for the nineteenth oentenary of Virgil's death⁷
1881.

Roman virgil, thou that singest Ilion’s lofty temples robed in fire,

Ilion falling, Rome arising, wars, and filial saith, and Dido's pyre ς

Landscape-lover‚ lord of language more than he that sang the VVorks
and Days,

All the chosen eoin of fancy flashing out from many a golden phrase ς

Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard, hive and
horse and herd3

All the eharm of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word ς

Poet os the happy Tityrus piping underneath his beeohen bowers :

Poet of the poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers ;

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying in the blisssul years again to be,

Summers of the snakeless meadOW, unlaborious earth and oarless sea ;

Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind;

Thou majestie in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind ς

Light among the vanished ages ς star that gildest yet this phantom
shore ς

Golden branch amjd the shadows, kings and realms that pass to rise no
more ς

Now thy Forum roars no longer ς fallen every purple Caesar’s dome—

Tho¹ thine ocean-roll of rhythm sound for ever of Imperial Rome—-

Now the Rome of slaves bath pedsh’d, and the Rome offreemen holds
her place ς

Ι, from out the Northern IslansL sunder’d once from all the human race,

1 salute thee, MantovanQ I that loved thee since my day began,

Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.

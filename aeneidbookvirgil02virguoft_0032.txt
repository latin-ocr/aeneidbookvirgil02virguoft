·V.—TH1‹] METRE OF THF] AENEID.

The principle upon which rhythm is based in English poetry
is a. regular succession of accented and unaccented syllables.
In Latin, accenb has nothing to do with scansion, which
depensis rassher on the regular succession of long and short
syllables·

LONG ANI) SHORT SYLLABLES.

A long syllable is one containing a long vowel, or a diph-
thong,* or even a short vowel before two consonants‚ orj3 x, or
z,- ay. the firsb syllable in each of the following words is
long: primus, aedes, mentis, major, texo, qaza. Even if one
of the lawo consonants be ab the beginning of another word
this rnle holds, ey. the syllable sub is short: in sub ipsa, but
long in sub montem. But the rule does not always hold when
the two consonan‘cs arel or r preceded by some other letter3
e. y. the first: syllable of patris may be short or long.

A shorb syllable is one containing a short vowel (except in
the cases mentioned in th» preceding paragraph), including
regularly all cases where a vowel is followed by another vowel
or diphthong, ay. the first syllable in tenet, deus, deae, is
short. Bun genitives iu ius have i sometimes short sometimes
long, and many proper names⁷ borrowed from the Greek (in
which this rnle does not, hold) have a long vowel before another
vowel or dilihthong, eff. the second syllable of Aeneas, Orion.

In scansion h is nob considered, so thal] ‘che first, syllable of
⁷ adhuc is not long, while in mihi the first syllable is shorb as
certainly as if it were spelled m ii.

Syllables then may be short or long either by nature or by
position.

³* The only diphthongs in Latin are ae, αιι, eu, ei, oe and ui, the two
first being far the commonest.

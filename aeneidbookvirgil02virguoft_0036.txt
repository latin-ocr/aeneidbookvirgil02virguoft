pause in the sense, or with Greek proper names. Such ar.
omission of elision is called Hiatus.

4. Oecasionally i before a vowel is given the sound of the
semi—vowel gs,- e. y. abiete pronouneed almae, three syllables
instead of four. In such cases the 3] sound counts as a conso·
nant in making position. Other words are occasionally
shortened, e. 9. deinde (trisyllable) treated as if ei were a diph-
thong. This shortening is called synaeresis or Synizesis.

5. Rarely the number of syllables in a word is increased
by breaking up a diphthong. This is called Diaeresis.

6. Syllables regularly long are sometimes shortened, chiefly
in the ending erunt of the perfect indic. active, and in the

ending ius of the gen. sing. This is oalled systole. It will be ⁴

remembered that before combinations of a mute and a liquid
(ay. br, tr, cl) syllables often vary in quantity. This same
variation occurs in other cases also in proper names.

7. A final syllable regularly short is sometimes lengthened.
This lengthening (which is called Diastole) occurs only in the
first syllable of a foot and generally at the caesural pause.
In almost every case the syllable was originally long.

8. It is the exception for a line to end in a monosyllable.
This occurs generally where Virgil is imitating some earlier
Latin poet, or where the sense corresponds to the abrupt
ending.

9. Sometimes the fifth foot is a spondee⁷ chiefly for the
expression of some slow measured movement, or impressive
act, or in Greek proper names. Where this occurs we have a
*Spondaic line.

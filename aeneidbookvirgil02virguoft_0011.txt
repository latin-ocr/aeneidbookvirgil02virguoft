PREFACE.

 

THIS edition of Virgil is intended for students of Latin
preparing for Junior Leaving and University Matriculation
examinationsâ€š to almost all of whom this portion of Virgil wil]
be the first Latin poetry ever read, For this reason many
things have been omitted that are commonly found in anno-
tated texts, such as parallel passages, Greek quotations, dis-
cussions ot various readings or of other intricate questions, and
subtlet-ies of interpretation which are beyond the pupil 's grasp.
For the same reason a considerable degree ot immaturity is
often presupposed in the reader of the notes and introduction.
Throughout, the degree of acquaintance with Latin likely to
have been gained from reading two books of Caesar has been
kept in vieW.

Believing that the average student in our High Schools has
but a limited appreciation of poetry written in his native
English, and that the difficulties caused by the foreign medium
will to the beginner in Virgil prevent even that moderate
. degree of aesthetic appreciation possible in the case of English
poetry, the editor has endeavored chiefly to help the pupil to a
clear understanding of the poet's meaning, leaving apprecia-
tion or enjoyment of the beauties ot the poem to come, as
alone they will, with increasing acquaintance with Latin.
And here interest in the story of the Aeneid 1nust not be con-
founded with enjoyment of Virgil's poetry. The latter is the
privilege of the few3 the former is possible to any one who
can read English

SPECIAL FEATURES AND IRREGULARITIES.

Another beauty of this metre is the possibilities it affords of
imitative harmony3 exoited, or rapid action being often
expressed in a line where daotyls abound, and solemn or

difficult actions brought out by a line abounding in spondees.

these half lines may be intentional or very expressive of eer-

2. In a few cases a superfluous syllable (generally que) is
found at the end ot a line, regularly where there could be an
elision with the first word of the next line. Such a case is
called Hypermeter or Synapheia.

3. In certain lines, where an elision might occur, it does

11. —THE STORY OF THE AENEID.

BOOK 1.-1t is now the seventah year since Troy fell, and
Aeneas with his body of exiles is still wandering over the seas,
parsued by the unrelenting hate ot J uno (who had been fore-
mosb in compassing 13116 destruction of Troy), so that he has
11013 yet: been able to found the city from which imperial Rome
was to spring.

As Aeneas is sailing from Sicily, J uno induces Aeolus, god
of the winds, 130 raise a storm which scatters the flee‘o and
drives some of them ashore. But Neptune, ‘che lord of the sea,
rebukes 13116 winds and quells the storm, and Aeneas with
seven of his ships lands on the coast of Africa.

Venus, the mother of Aeneas, complains to Jupiter that the
destiny decreed for Aeneas is being thwarted by J uno, bun her
anxiety is dispelled by his promise ‘ohan in due time a kingdom
shall be founded in Italy, which shall grow into the world-
wide empire of the Oaesars. Mercury is sent 130 ensure Aeneas‘
welcome by 13116 people of Carthage, near which ciby he has
landed. ’

Aeneas sbarbs out 130 explore 13116 counbry and meets Venus
in the disguise of a hunbress, who tells him of Carthage, and
its recent, founding by Queen Dido and a band of fugitives
from Tyre. Then bidding him go to the city, she leaves him,
revealing her godhead as she vanishes.

Aeneas, invisible in a cloud, enters the city, sees with envy
the people busily raising their new home, and finds that, 13116
crews of his other vessels have been saved and brought to

‘Carthago before the Queen. When Dido extends a gracious
welcome to these shipwrecked Trojans, ‘ohe cloud falls from
Aeneas, who greets his friends and reveals himself to Dido.

Venus is anxious that. Dido shall learn to love Aeneas, that
he may be sate from harm in this city, which was sacred 130 ·

In a vision Hector appears to Aeneas, tells h1m that Troy
is lost, bids him fiee and entrusts the gods of Troy to his care.
Aeneas awaking finds the city in flames and rushes forth,
joined by other Tro-iam, to oppose the Greeks. But his efforts
are in vain, his followers are killed and Aeneas sees king Priam
slain and his palace and the whole oitadel in possession of the
foe,

His goddess mother now appears and bids him rescue his
own family. His father Anchises is at first unwilling to flee,
but is overcorne by omens that betoken divine guidance and
protection. Aeneas sets out bearing his aged father and the
gods of Troy and leading his little son by the hand. His
wife Creusa follows but in the confusion is lost. When they
have reached a place of safety outside the city walls, Aeneas
discovering her loss returns to the city in search of her. He
finds the Greeks everywhere victorious, but there is no trac-,e
of Creusa. Suddenly her shade appears to him, to tell him
that she has been saved from captivity by death. She bids
him escape7 and he returns to his friends, whom he finds joined
by many more Trojans. With these at dawn he makes his
way to the mountains near Troy.

BOOK ΙΙΙ. —The Trojan fugitives bm'ld a fleet and eross over
to Thrace where they proceed to found a city. But as Aeneas
is gathering boughs for a sacrifice, drops of blood trickle from
them aNnd a voice tells him he is by the grave of Polydorus, a
son of Priam‚ who had been sent with much treasure for safety
to the Thracians‚ and had been murdered by them.

Leaving this polluted spot they sail ‘to Delos where the
oracle bids them seek their ancient mother—city. Anchises
says this is Crete, from which their ancestor Teucer had come,
and to Crete they steer. But scarcely have they begun to build
a city, when a pestilence breaks out. In a vision the gods of
his ancestors appear to Aeneas, and tell him that it is
another land in the west, called Italy, which he must seek
from which Dardanus had. come in ancient times.

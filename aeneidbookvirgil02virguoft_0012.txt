iv tumme-E.

It mli! be noticeo that less help than is· usual in simila* edi-
tions is given in the way of translation of passages. Instead
of this, special care has been taken with tho vocabulary, that
it may be not merely complete and accurate, but such as to
enable the student to render his author neatly and with suit-
able diction. That the Vocabulary covers six books of the
Aeneid will be of advantage in developing the pupil's skill and
taste in seleoting the right meaning of words, without hamper-
ing him with too large a ohoiee.

The illustrations, which are adapted from Pinelli's designs,
will aid matemally in giving vividness and clearness to the
pupil's conceptione.

If errors or misprints have eludod observation⁷ the editor
will value more highly the kindness which points them out
than the indulgenoe which 0v01·100ks them.
